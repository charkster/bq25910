Python Class for controlling BQ25910

BQ25910.py was created from the TI datasheet and verified on the BQ25910EVM-854 board (which also has a BQ25898D master charger). test_bq25898d.py is an example of controlling both the bq25898d and bq25910 with a raspberry pi and custom relay board.

I hope to upload thermal images of the bq25910 charging at 3, 4, 5 and 6A later.
